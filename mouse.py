def mouse(x: int, y: int, doubleClick: bool, button: int):
	"""
	Function to perform mouse actions (move and click) at specific screen coordinates.

	Parameters:
	- x (int): The horizontal position on the screen to move the mouse to.
	- y (int): The vertical position on the screen to move the mouse to.
	- doubleClick (bool): If True, double-click. If False, single-click.
	- button (int): Mouse button to click (1 for left, 2 for middle, 3 for right).

	As the AI, you will call this function to automate mouse actions. You should first
	analyze the user's screenshot to find the position of the element to click. Then,
	use this function to move the mouse to that position and perform the click action.

	This function returns a dictionary with detailed information about the mouse action,
	including:
	- The coordinates where the mouse was moved.
	- The type of click performed (single or double).
	- The mouse button that was used (left, middle, or right).
	- The userâ€™s screen context, such as the location and action performed.
